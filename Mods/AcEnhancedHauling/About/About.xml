	<description>Make Colonists works smarter. 

Now Colonists have common sense, so they grab everything as possible as they can and store to nearest storage depot before start working. Instead of haul one by one. If a stockpile is farther than working ground or the colonist is incapable of hauling, they work as normal. It Currently works only with cooking, constructing and some hauling job.
